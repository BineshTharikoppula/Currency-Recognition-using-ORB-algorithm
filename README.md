# Currency-Recognition-using-ORB-algorithm
Implemented an algorithm using ORB of OpenCV Python library which is capable of detecting keypoints and visual descriptor of image used to compare given currency note with trained data set.

currency_recog.py --> is the actual source code.(Run this File)   
utils.py --> this file contains various image processing methods.

Trained DataSet Folder --> it's having different currency note images in which 20.jpg,50.jpg,100.jpg,500.jpg are trained data sets while the remaining are test cases for our program.
